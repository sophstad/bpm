Beats Per Month helps visualize my listening habits. At the moment, it’s just Weird CSS, my first exposure to Flask, and practice with Python, but I’d eventually like it to evolve into something useful. Watch this space!

## Right Now
At this point, bpm:
- Takes my top 50 artists from the past month and displays them in an ordered list (most to fewest listens)
- Takes an image of each of these artists, arranges them into a seamless grid, and uses this as the page's background
- Displays my top 10 artists from the past seven days as this list (on a separate page), over a background that subtly changes color

## Planned Additions
- Utilize AJAX for page transitions
- Weekly snapshots (with a new page added after each week)
- Integration of Spotify data
- Area for comments on data
- Charts (from charted.co, Chartkick, or other) depicting (maybe) weekly variance in listening
