Beats Per Month helps visualize my listening habits. At the moment, it’s just Weird CSS, my first exposure to Flask, and practice with Python, but I’d eventually like it to evolve into something useful. Watch this space!

## Planned Additions
- Utilize AJAX for page transitions
- Weekly snapshots (with a new page added after each week)
- Integration of Spotify data
- Area for comments on data
- Charts (from charted.co, Chartkick, or other) depicting (maybe) weekly variance in listening
